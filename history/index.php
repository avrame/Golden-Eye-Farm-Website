          <h1>A Short History of Goldeneye Farm</h1>
          <p>
            The land that now comprises Goldeneye Farm is part of Orcas Islandâ€™s
            more than a century old history of apple and strawberry farming. The
            main house on the property was built in 1984, but the majority of
            apple trees are more than one hundred years old. The apple trees at
            Goldeneye Farm are heirloom varieties, many of them unique to the
            island and surrounding areas. Not all of the trees have been
            identified, but they include Wine Sap, Pippins, Gravensteins, and King
            Apples. The large apple tree, lying on its side near the house and
            small ponds, is a King apple tree and is likely over 110 years old.

          <p>
            Many of the apple trees at Goldeneye Farm produce small, sweet apples
            that have historically been used for cider.  The 27 apple trees on the
            property produce, on average, over 7 tons of fruit.  The fruit is
            pressed each season, usually during a community celebration in
            October/November, and yields around 175 gallons of cider each year.
            Along with apples, past and present owners of Goldeneye Farm have
            added raspberry and blueberry bushes, Native Plums, Asian Plums, Sour
            Cherries, Frost Peaches, and various vegetables, herbs, and flowers.
