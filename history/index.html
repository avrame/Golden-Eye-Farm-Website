          <h1>The History of Goldeneye Farm</h1>
          <p>In the 1860's William Moore (1827-1897) came by ship to Olga, set up camp in the valley above Buck Bay, and applied for a homestead. He was a southerner who first came to Orcas Island after first joining thousands of others seeking gold during the Fraser River Gold Rush. He was the first of the settlers, and his 320 acre homestead just east of the hamlet near Buck Bay followed Pickett Springs Creek. It started at Obstruction Pass Road and extended up through the valley to the origination of the springs on the property of Parker and Sterns. William Moore married Alma, a native woman. His granddaughter, Ma{orie Klingman of Anacortes, related a story of Moore 'buying' his young wife on the beach at Stockade Bay (now known as Buck Bay) from a native elder. Alma Moore was Chief Seattle's niece, originally from the Duwamish tribe.</p>
          <p>William and Alma Moore had nine children: Jefferson Davis Moore, who was well- known as the storekeeper at Dolphin Bay and Olga, Robert, Jessie (Lane), Mary (Robertson), Samuel, Anna (Davis), Ella (Reed), Nancy, and William Jr (whose son, William III, drowned in Cascade Lake in 1932).</p>
          <p>In 1872 it was determined by a vote of 43 residents that a school was needed and since the San Juans were then part of Whatcom County, it was approved as School District Number 14, Whatcom County. J. H. Bowman, whose properfy lay south of the Moore land extending to Stockade Bay, posted a bond of $500 for the school. It was named the Olga- Doe Bay School and covered all residents on the South side of the island, since there was no road linking the north and south sides of Orcas Island. Mr. Moore was on the initial Board of Directors. The initial location was the local church. Later, William Moore donated the land for the first schoolhouse in Olsa in 1900.</p>
          <p>The Moore homestead, currently owned by Emory Emmes, is located just north of the intersection of Obstruction Pass Road and Point Lawrence, (see orange arrow) and was built inthe 1860's. Ella Moore, William Moore's daughter, witnessed the murder of Jack Hand in 1902 in front of their house. She later testified in court, and was mentioned in the newspaper articles for her stunning beauty and "innocent, artless testimony". Jane Barfoot-Hodde recalls her very well, and insists she was the most beautiful woman on eastern Orcas Island. Successively, the farm was used by William Moore's descendents for subsistence agriculture, apple orchards, livestock gtazing, and in the 1930's and 1940's the land was leased out to the Rodenberger's for strawberry farming</p>
          <p>The last remaining Moores in Olga were Billy (William Jr.) Moore and Jeff Moore, the storekeeper. Billy was part Indian with a full Indian wife, who sold his share of the Moore inheritance, (the eastern part of the Moore homestead) in parcels in 1968. The SE corner lot at Obstruction Pass was purchased and still owned by Tim and Marsha Segault.</p>
          <p>The next property eastward and south across Point Lawrence Road, adjacent to Goldeneye Farm is the Buck Bay B&amp;8. The B&amp;B itself is the renovated barn of the Moore's family, and between the B&amp;B and Goldeneye Farm is a dilapidated "quarters" house for farm help and the root cellar {br the Moore family. The barn was renovated by Rick and Janet Bronkey into a seven guest room B&amp;B and named Buck Bay Inn. The renovated barn and now B&amp;B (see blue arrow) has gone through several owners, and is now owned by Brick and Angie Barrick.</p>
          <p>The properfy next along Point Lawrence Road, now named Goldeneye Farm, was initially 15 acres and was sold to Bud and Theresa Winslow, in 1968. Latet, they negotiated the sale and easement of the SW 5 acres to the San Juan Preservation Trust. This ensured that the north side of the hill on the opposite side of Pickett Springs Creek would remain forever pristine. In 1984 they retired from academia and built a farm house, and in 1989 they extended out the front of the house and covered in the breezeway between the house and garage. Bud was a former University professor in agriculture and wished to practice what he taught, that is, farming self-sufficiency. They named the property Sunshine Farm, fenced and cross fenced the acreage, dug the pond, a "backhoe" well for the livestock, and later drilled a well in the pasture which has almost artesian flow rates.</p>
          <p>They raised hogs, chickens, ducks and other livestock, created a kitchen garden, and planted raspberries and blueberries for sale along with the apple crop. Theresa also raised sheep, primarily for the wool which she carded and wove into textiles.</p>
          <p>In 1995 when the Winslows had to leave the island for health reasons, the property was purchased by Rich and Kate Lee, and renamed "Goldeneye Farm". Rich had a graphic arts firm with the same name, and both were fascinated with the Barrows Goldeneye Duck, seen frequently passing along the western flyway in Alaska. . Richard was a Professor in Biology from the University of Alaska, and became the Noxious Weed Control Officer for the County. He is also a well-regarded photographer. His wife is a Master Gardener and between the two of them they enhanced the collection of rhododendrons, lilacs, and roses that Teresa Winslow had collected by extending out the dear fencing, expanding the house beds and planting several hundred smaller perennials and annuals. They also pastured llamas and alpacas.</p>
          <p>The Lees in turn sold the property to Pat Diviney and Steve Garrison in 2000. The major ceintribution of the latest owners has been to restore the land by altering its configuration back to that of the turn of the last century, before the combination of strawberry plantings and winter rains flowing off the south side of Mount Constitution had silted up Pickett Springs Creek. The land has been cleaned up from the earlier agricultural endeavors, and water flows have been diverted back down to the Creek. There is also an attempt underway by a coalition of environmental groups to renovate the Creek itself, where locals indicate that salmon were running as late as the 1950's.</p>
          <p>Some of the old apple trees still remain and march in line down the valley toward Buck Bay. Since the loam is over six feet deep in some of the pastures, the trees have been unable to find bedrock for their roots and some have fallen over on their sides, but they still continue, after a hundred years, to produce in volume. Not all trees have been identified, but there is one Wine Sap, and many 22oz Pippins, Gravensteins, and King Apples. The majority of trees produce a small very small sweet apple used for cider production. There is one King apple lying on it's side next to the house which is reputed to be 110 years old and is still in production. Overall, the farm produces about 175 gallons of cider each year. The raspberry and blueberry beds serve the Garrisons and their friends in Olga, and there is sufficient production of Native Plums, Sour Cherries, Asian Plums, Frost Peaches and vegetables from the kitchen gardens to provide produce self sufficiency and preserved fruit and vegetables for the winter and also Christmas gifts. The harvest of 27 apple trees, some seven tons, and the subsequent pressing into cider is a community affair in Olga happening every mid-November.</p>
