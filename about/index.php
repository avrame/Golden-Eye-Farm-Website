          <h1>About Goldeneye Farm</h1>
          <p>
            Goldeneye Farm is a 10-acre heritage property located in the quiet
            village of Olga on Orcas Island, part of the San Juan Archipelago off
            the coast of Washington State. The beautiful 2447-sq. ft. house has
            2-bedrooms plus 2-bathrooms, a large kitchen, dining and living room
            area, and a vast deck that provides beautiful views of the property.
            Goldeneye Farm features an heirloom orchard with 100+-year-old apple
            trees, pear trees, peach trees, plum trees, cherry trees, a large
            field, as well as a fenced-in, deer-proof garden area with
            raspberries, blueberries, and grapes. There are two small ponds by
            the house and a larger one near the lower end of the property, which
            is adjoined by an alder bog.
          </p>

            Guests are welcome to pick the fruit and berries of the season
            throughout their stay at Goldeneye Farm.  The house also features a
            separate office and library area with a state-of-the-art printer,
            desktop computers, and beautiful views of the orchard and ponds. The
            office can be rented at extra-charge by those who would like to have
            access to an extra quiet room, may need to work during their stay,
            or would like to spend their sabbatical in this inspiring place.
